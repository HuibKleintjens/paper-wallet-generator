Paper Wallet Generator
======================

A paper wallet is a method of keeping a private key safe, allowing you to store your MaxCoin offline. This method is known as "cold storage", and is the safest way to store cryptocurrency long-term.

To put your coins into cold storage, first generate a MaxCoin address using this generator, then send your coins to this address. You will be given the corresponding private key to the MaxCoin address and, when you want to access your coins, you can use this to add the address to a wallet, using the "importprivkey" function.

This generator is written in pure JavaScript so you can run it from your browser. At no time does the website operator see your private key.
